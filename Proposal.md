**Blood Oxygen Level Monitor Ring**
__________________________________
I propose to build a SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Level) monitoring ring, allowing user to know their current condition.

**Summary**
__________________________________
Blood oxygen level is a crucial value for health, its closely related to brain activities and physical performance. It is common for user with breathing problem, such as asthma, dropping the SpO2 value below 95. Healthy people usually rated 95-100%, dropping below 95% is abnormal, and below 90% could be potentially harmful over time. It is common for many of the athletes / fitness enthusiast to experience short of breath, dizziness and many other issues could potentially caused by the drop of SpO2. Many amateurs, even coaches would have their athletes rest a fixed amount time between sets, from 30s to 2 minutes, this rest time between sets is often determine the goals of the athletes (muscle building/ power training). Insufficient rest time equals low SpO2 level, which leads to lower performance level and could potentially lead to injury, due to the bad decision made while the brain is not performing at its peak. The SpO2 ring can help the users determine when their body is ready to work, either with their head or with their hand.

**Component Parts**
__________________________________

Pulse Oximeter, its a affordable device which detects SpO2 level and pulse. I’ll be purchasing the oximeter and turn it into a ring (if possible).

Coding: ajskdhfaksdkfahsd?!?!?!??

**Challenges**
__________________________________
Coding. 
Oximeter works by shooting rays through the finger, and on the other end the receiver will be determining the value of SpO2 by how much rays its receiving. Blood is not just red liquid, but bunch of red cells and other component will effect the data, such as vessels and bones, the more component between the light source and light detector, the lower the score of SpO2 will be. (Oximeter was designed to be placed on the finger tip, instead of on the fingers, thinker/more component= less accurate)
And coding.

**Timeline**
__________________________________
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!
	•	Week 1: Write proposal
	•	Week 2: Data collecting(buy oximeter)
	•	Week 3: turn it into a ring(if possible)+coding
	•	Week 4: if it can't be worn as a ring, figure out how to attach it. + Coding
	•	Week 5: Present!
